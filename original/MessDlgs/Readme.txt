My another software:

Programs:

BiCat - 
A utility for viewing, storing and cataloging small image files (glyphs). 
Bitmaps from BiCat may be used for program development (speedbuttons, toolbars) 
and WWW pages design (background, bullets, marks). It supports BMP, ICO, EMF 
and WMF formats. Saves disk space by storing all your glyph files in 
BiCat database. It helps to avoid cluster losses for small files. 
More than 2000 glyphs (bitmaps and icons) are available for registered users. 
It is very convenience for programers. I'm using it with RxLib PicEdit 
(which has Copy/Paste buttons) and Delphi Image Editor in 
everyday programing practice.

HTML-View - 
Easy to use viewer for WWW file formats. Features: browse by file, file name as 
command line parameter, file and folder bookmarks, supports animated GIFs, 
search in files, file operations, and more. 
Requires installed MS Internet Explorer v3.01 or later

PicViewer - 
Image viewer for most common file formats. PicViewer displays images in the following 
formats: BMP, ICO, WMF, EMF, GIF, JPEG, PNG, PCX, TIFF, PCD. Features: slide show, 
browse by image file, image file name as command line parameter, supports animated GIFs, 
bookmarks, file operations, image converter, and more.

Delphi:

TQuickFileList -
an Explorer-like file ListView component which replaces
old Win3.1-style TFileListBox (for Delphi 2 and Delphi 3).

TnfPanel -
TPanel's descendant that allows to remove flicker of inserted 
controls during panel resizing. Also removes Delphi 3 repaint bug and adds 
FullRepaint property for Delphi 2 (for Delphi 2 and Delphi 3).

TScrollPanel v1.0 - 
combines TPanel and TScrollBox capabilities

Progress is a sample unit for creating an indicator window during long-time 
program processing (for Delphi 2 and Delphi 3).

propreties to limit a split line (for Delphi 2 and Delphi 3).
